This showcases the code used to create a dashboard for a local nonprofit.
In this project I was assigned the task to create a dashboard that showed off timeseries trends for a local nonprofit. For privacy reasons, the company will not be named and the final dashboard will not be shown. This familiarized me with the concepts of creating a dashboard in R. I got to experiment with different themes and color patterns and come up with a dashboard that presented some key findings as well as some recommendations for the company.
